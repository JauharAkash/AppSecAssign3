In order to create the migrations_job.yaml file in part2 of the directory, I copied the code from the /GiftcardSite/k8/django-deploy.yaml. Then I added the following line on line 13: 

"command: ["python3", "manage.py", "migrate"]"

As discussed in Kevin's office hours and also used in Assignment 2, this command is basically used to run and perform the database migration. Everything else in the .yaml file are parameters/varaibles used to access the database which is why I haven't made any changes to any other lines of code. 

Following are the commands used to test and validate this part of the assignment - 

minikube delete
(restarted my VM)
minikube start
eval $(minikube docker-env)
docker build -t nyuappsec/assign3:v0 .
docker build -t nyuappsec/assign3-proxy:v0 proxy/
docker build -t nyuappsec/assign3-db:v0 db/
kubectl apply -f db/k8
kubectl apply -f GiftcardSite/k8
kubectl apply -f proxy/k8
kubectl apply -f GiftcardSite/k8/securing-secrets-part1.yaml
kubectl apply -f db/k8/db-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f db/k8s/db-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f GiftcardSite/k8/django-deploy.yaml
kubectl apply -f Part2/migrations_job.yaml

kubectl get pods
kubectl get service
minikube service proxy-service
kubectl get pods --> Saw the 'NAME' - migrationjob




Then, to sart the seeding part of the assignment, I created the database_seeding_job.yaml file (Part2/database_seeding_job.yaml). The shell command on line 13 helped in the seeding and line number 14 passed the paramater to make the connection. Then, I created a file called seed.sql (db/seed.sql) to load the data for the job. I also created a new image for this part of this lab.

Following are the commands used to test and validate this part of the assignment - 

docker build -t nyuappsec/assign3_part2_seeding:v0 .
docker build -t nyuappsec/assign3_part2_seeding-proxy:v0 proxy/
docker build -t nyuappsec/assign3_part2_seeding-db:v0 db/
kubectl apply -f Part2/database_seeding_job.yaml
kubectl get pods
kubectl get service
minikube service proxy-service
